In Chrome, User goes to: http://example.com/home


Browser -> Request -> Routes -> Controller <-> Model 
 (View)                             |
   ^                                v
   |                                |
   +--<--- Response <----<----<-----+


Where model includes the entire state of the application:
  Users, Companies, Any database value
  Status requests from workers

The 'view' also has methods for creating requests to send to the
controller.

The view's requests can be of different formats like json or html. The
routes direct the request to the right part of controller. The
controller formats the view response as json or html, it is the view's
job to render them appropriately.

A request at the Controller level can combine queries of different
portions of the model to create a response.  Or the controller can pass
entire database objects like is typically done in this application. The
jinja templates then extract the relevant portions at the response level
and are sent to the browser view.
