Yet another python virtual environment and package manager. Why?

All you have to remember is to type pipenv at the start of every python
related command.

This gives you tracked packages, automatically. You can never add a
package on development and not have it committed to the repository.

All the other goodness: lightweight, cross platform, DWIM, etc.

For example, on miniconda the workflow is:

conda create --name my_env
source activate my_env
  write some code - I need package psutil
  pip install psutil
  (or was it conda install - does conda have that package?)
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
commit changes

Deploy to production
Production environment runs code, at which point you discover you forgot
to pip freeze, or a version number changed somewhere.

In contrast:
pipenv install
write some code - I need package psutil
pipenv install psutil  (pipenv records dependency automatically)

Deploy to production
Production environment runs pipenv install, which automatically installs
the psutil dependency.
